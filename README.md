Folder Icon Assigner was developed by me, Warkanum also known as Hein Puth. 
The idea was to customise my folders with icons and I came up with folder icon assigner. 
This program serves only as a tool to assigned icons to folders. 
These icon will always be there once you assign them. 
You can remove icons from folders by using the remove button.
Please note the this program modifies the desktop.ini file inside folder and also copies an icon with the folder name into the folder.
